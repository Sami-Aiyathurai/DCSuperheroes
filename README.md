This is a personal project of mine that I started first to get a better understanding of DFS vs BFS. 

Currently this program uses BFS to to crawl through Wikipedia's pages on DC Comic's Superheroes. Starting with Superman, it goes through the first 50 links of each page it visits and if a link is to another superhero's page(Currently determined by .txt files in the repository) that page is added to the queue of pages to crawl through.

My future hope is to use the crawler program to make a visual graph of the way various DC Superheroes link to one another on Wikipedia. More hopes might come along as I work on it
